# Bank Loan Case Study
#### Using Microsoft Excel

## Introduction
This is a exploratory case study where we are provided with 3 datasets namely: columns description, previous application and application data. The data provides applicants details and applications on which we use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in the data and ensure that the capable applicants are not rejected.

**Company faces two risks when applied for loan:**
- If the applicant can repay the loan but is not approved, the company loses business.
- If the applicant cannot repay the loan and is approved, the company faces a financial loss.

## Project Goal
When a customer applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes:
- **Approved:** The company has approved the loan application.
- **Cancelled:** The customer cancelled the application during the approval process.
- **Refused:** The company rejected the loan.
- **Unused Offer:** The loan was approved but the customer did not use it.

Our goal in this project is to use EDA to understand how customer attributes and loan attributes influence the likelihood of defaults.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Data Analytical Tasks
- Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately
- Identify Outliers in the Dataset
- Analyze Data Imbalance
- Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis
- Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios

## Results
From these analysis we can interpret that:
- **Outliers:** the columns such as cnt_children, amt_income_total, years employed, etc with high values of outliers such as 11 children, income of 117000000, 1000 years of work experience, etc need to be reviewed.
- **Data imbalance:** through this we can analyse the difference between the categories of a column. This gives the ratio of imbalance in categorical data such as gender, loan type, educational qualification, etc. which is crucial for building business models and understanding the targets.
- **Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis:** these analysis helps in understanding the high demand categories, potential demands of target variables and comparison between 2 variables such as amt_income_total and amt_credit which helps in defining the risks of loan defaults.
- **Correlations:** these analysis defined the relationship between 2 variables which helps in understanding possible outcomes. The values of positive 1 indicates linear relationships between variables whereas negative 1 indicates inverse relationship. The value of 0 indicates no linear relationship.
